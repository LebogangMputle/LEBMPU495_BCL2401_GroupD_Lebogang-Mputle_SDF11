# Introduction
# 1. Project Overview
This project was aimed to test the our html,css and javascript skills more specifically using tailwind and I found tailwind as an easier to use frame works compared to using straight css which creates long codes which can cause you to make simple mistakes. I found this project very educational because I was able to learn a lot when it comes to styling and using both grid and flex box for layout styles.

# HTML Challenges
Organizing components and ensuring responsive design, these challenges where
1. Structuring the navigation menus for the desktop and the mobile devices.
2. Implementing semantic HTML for accessibility purposes.
3. Integrating SVG icons and images seamlessly.

Learning Outcomes:

1.Enhanced understanding of semantic HTML and its importance for accessibility and search engine optimization.
2.Improved skills in structuring and organizing complex layouts for responsive design.

# Tailwind css challenges
Tailwind css facilitated rapid prototyping and styling of components but presented challenges in managing utility classes and responsives design. these included:
1. Balancing readability and concisness in utility class usage.
2. Ensuring consistency in spacing, typography and color chemes accross components.
3. Customizing Tailwind configurations to meet design requirements.

Learning Outcomes:

1.Proficiency in leveraging utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and development.
2.Ability to customize and extend CSS frameworks to suit specific design needs.

# Grid Challenges
Grid layouts were used to structure sections and align content across different screen sizes. Challenges included:

1.Creating responsive grid layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
2.Implementing consistent spacing and alignment within grid cells.
3.Balancing flexibility and complexity in grid structure to accommodate diverse content.

Learning Outcomes:

1.Deepened understanding of CSS Grid and its capabilities for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
2.Skill development in designing grid-based layouts that maintain consistency and adaptability across devices.

# Flexbox Challenges
Flexbox was employed to align and distribute items within containers, particularly in navigation menus and content sections. Challenges included:

1.Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and consistent behavior across devices.
2.Handling nested flex containers and maintaining flexibility in layout design.
3.Addressing challenges related to centering content vertically and horizontally.

Learning Outcomes:

1.Mastery of Flexbox concepts and techniques for building flexible and efficient layouts.
2.Ability to solve complex layout challenges by leveraging Flexbox's powerful alignment.

# JavaScript Challenges
JavaScript was utilized to implement interactive features such as mobile navigation toggles and these challenges included:
1.Ensuring smooth transitions
2.Implementing event listeners and handlers for user interactions.

Learning Outcomes:

1.Improved proficiency in JavaScript programming, particularly in DOM manipulation and event handling.
2.Enhanced understanding of JavaScript's role in creating interactive and dynamic web experiences.

# Following the prescribed video's to complete the website challenges:
1. Some of the videos where really difficult to follow because of the video quality and long codes which needed to be typed manually without coping and pasting them.

# Conclusion
Throught out the creation of this website, I have learned a lot when it comes to using tailwind frameworks and manipulating the DOM. I also leanerd how using different colors and hover effects can help make a website, user friendly and eye catching.
